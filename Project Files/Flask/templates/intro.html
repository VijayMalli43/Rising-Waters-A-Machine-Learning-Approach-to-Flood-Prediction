    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
        Flood forecasting is the use of forecasted precipitation and streamflow data
        to predict flood events in advance. Machine learning techniques help analyze
        historical rainfall patterns and environmental factors to identify flood risks.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this project, a machine learning model is trained using rainfall-related
        features such as cloud cover, annual rainfall, and seasonal rainfall data.
        The trained model predicts whether there is a chance of flood or not.
    </p>

    <p>
        This system helps authorities and individuals take preventive measures by
        providing early flood warnings and improving disaster preparedness.
